# poem-and-music-generation-and-poem-to-music-generation
This project creatively combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative Music to produce poetry and corresponding melodies. It uses GPT-2 to generate poems based on a given theme or prompt and then analyzes the poem’s emotion and rhythm to generate matching music. The entire workflow was developed and executed on Google Colab.
